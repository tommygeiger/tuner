# Spotify React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local Development

This assumes you have node js installed: 
```
brew install node
```

Clone (or fork) this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/tommygeiger/spotify-react-app
cd spotify-react-app
```

You'll need to change `redirectUri` in `src/Config.js` to `http://localhost/3000/`

Install dependencies and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

The app should be live at `http://localhost/3000`
